Creates an assembly of pages, categories, and external URLs into a nice heterogeneous list.

== Description ==

Creates an assembly of pages, categories, and external URLs into a nice heterogeneous list. For CMS applications of WordPress, organizing a menu list is a pain; this makes it easier. Drag and drop them until you like what you see. No hacks or finicky 'Page Order' methods need apply.

Use

1. Configure your list from the Menus Plus+ option page located in the 'Appearance' area. 
1. Place `<?php menusplus(); ?>` in your template ... wherever you want it.

Support

== Installation ==

1. Upload `menusplus.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php menusplus(); ?>` in your template ... wherever you want it

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What kinds of classes and ids are applied to the menu?  =

Only the normal classes and ids generated by WordPress (eg. `current-page-item`). For external URLs, you may assign an optional class to help styling. For the most part, the template tag will spit out a simple list without a parent container or style. Customize as you wish. 

= Will it do page and category children? =

You know it. Just change the "Children" option accordingly. At this time you cannot do highly customized orders of children, but you can sort them in a number of ways (date, id, name, etc ...).

== Screenshots ==

1. A view from the admin interface.
1. Add a page to the list. 
1. Adding an external URL.
