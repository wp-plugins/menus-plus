Create multiple customized menus with pages, posts, categories, and URLS. For CMS applications of WordPress, organizing a menu list is a pain; this makes it easier. Drag and drop them until you like what you see. No hacks or finicky 'Page Order' methods need apply.

1. Configure your lists from the Menus Plus+ option page at 'Appearance > Menus Plus+' 
1. Create some Menus Plus+ widgets via 'Appearance > Widgets'
1. Or use the template tag:
	1. Place `<?php menusplus(); ?>` in your template ... wherever you want it.
	1. If you have multiple lists, use the `<?php menusplus(#); ?>` tag provided on the configuration page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do these 'Hybrid' lists work? =

Essentially, you are embedding another Menus Plus+ list within your current list. This allows you to break the regular WordPress hierarchy and make submenus out of anything you want. Editing the hybrid lists take you to another menu list; hybrid list items are orange so you don't get confused. 

Hyrbid lists are only available to the parent list. Therefore you cannot use them as individual widgets. Sorry! It's just protect you from endless loops!

= What kinds of classes and ids are applied to the menu?  =

Only the normal classes and ids generated by WordPress (eg. `current-page-item`). For external URLs, you may assign an optional class to help styling. For the most part, the template tag will spit out a simple list without a parent container or style. Customize as you wish. 

= Will it do page and category children? =

You know it. Just change the "Children" option accordingly. At this time you cannot do highly customized orders of children, but you can sort them in a number of ways (date, id, name, etc ...).

= How do I return my separate lists? =

You can either create a widget for that specific list through 'Appearance > Widgets', or use the template tag.

When you edit a list, a little box beneath gives you the correct template tag for showing that particular list. For example, `<?php menusplus(3); ?>`. If you leave out the number, the earliest list is returned. 

= Will the widget necessarily display the widgets title? =

The widget will display a title only if you supply one. If the list is going to be your main navigation, and you don't want the list title to be show, simply leave it blank. 

= What about the URL for the 'top' hyrbid list item? =

When you create/edit a hybrid list you have the option of supplying a URL. This will make the top, or parent list item, a functioning link as well. If you leave it blank, the item will still be a link (with a `<a>` tag), but it will have a blank `href` parameter. This ensures that your beautifully customized CSS dropdowns don't soil themselves.
